U. S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Sunday he was open to raising taxes on the rich, backing off his prior proposal to reduce taxes on all Americans and breaking with one of his party's core policies dating back to the 1990s.

"I am willing to pay more, and you know what, the wealthy are willing to pay more," Trump told ABC's"This Week."

After effectively sealing the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election last week, Trump has used speeches and interviews to offer more details on his policy positions.

The billionaire real estate tycoon has said he would like to see an increase in the minimum wage, although he told NBC's"Meet the Press"on Sunday he would prefer to see states take the lead on that front instead of the federal government.

"I don't know how people make it on$ 7. 25 an hour," Trump said of the current federal minimum wage.

"I would like to see an increase of some magnitude.
